# NeuralNet_Digit_Classifier

Application for recognizing handwritten digits, designed for input through a laptop trackpad.

First in Category at Santa Clara Valley Synopsys Science Fair. https://science-fair.org/

One significant purpose of this project was to learn about Neural Networks; thus, the code is not optimized, and all functions (such as gradient descent) were coded from scratch instead of using libraries.
